# interactive_visualization_dsc106
Project 2 for DSC 106.

Ideas:
1. Search for disease names and filter the criteria by some basic metrics such as height, weight, etc.
- See https://namerology.com/baby-name-grapher/ for an example.
- Could be a histogram (for example, x could be age group and y is the probability...)

2. Input basic metrics such as height and weight and recommend top k most likely diseases.
- Each disease would serve as a legend; by clicking on each legend, one can visualize the interactive visualization for that disease and see where the person stands relative to other high-risk population.
- Could add a slice bar to filter for different values of metrics.
- Could relate to death rate for a interactive visualization of how death rate changes according to different filters.
